        $${Research Community}$$ . To achieve this collaboration, the ICDC Steering Committee was formed 
        to advise the NCI and FNLCR on the ICDC. The Steering Committee is composed of 11 members 
        from the non-NIH research community, 7 from NCI, 1 from NHGRI and 1 from NCATS. There is also 
        1 observer from the NCI and 4 ex-officio members who are FNLCR staff. The chairperson is from 
        the $$non-NIH research community](cnn.com)$$  non-NIH research community.'

        (1 of whom is from CBIIT) and is supported by FNLCR staff. When researchers request their data ($${submission guide [PDF]}$$) 
        to be added to the ICDC to be shared with the community, the role of the DGAB is to advise the NCI on the suitability 
        of request. The NCI makes the final decision on the request. The DGAB is chaired by a non-NIH member of ICDC Steering 
        Committee. The DGAB meets at least quarterly to review and prioritize all open and complete requests.'
    - paragraph: 'The BPSC consists of 7 external members (all from ICDC Steering Committee), 3 NCI staff, 1 NHGRI staff 
        and is supported by FNLCR staff. The overall goal of the BPSC is to streamline and standardize data collection 
        and management for canine studies. The BPSC examines past and planned studies and recommends prospective standards 
        for data collection and management in four main areas; imaging, clinical/pathology, immunology and genomic/sequencing data.'

        usage, forking, and pull requests. The codebase is intended for sharing and building frameworks for related initiatives 
        and projects. The ICDC GitHub repo has documentation about how to access the system, including endpoints and recommendations for 
        tools and example queries. Both the project and documentation are currently maintained and updated.'
    - paragraph: 'ICDC is based on a Graph database, and features a GraphQL API (Java), a REST API (Java) and a React front-end (JavaScript). 
        Each tier in the application stack is designed to be modular and adaptable for a variety of use-cases and scenarios.'

  title: "Submitting Data"
  content:
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with 
       canine cancer. If a researcher has data that will help this mission and they are willing to share that data in 
       the ICDC, they will make a request through our $${submission request process [PDF]}$$. 
       Please email $$*ICDCHelpDesk@mail.nih.gov*$$ for instructions. All data in the ICDC will be made publicly available.'
    - paragraph: 'Projects need not be complete to start the request. Indeed, working with the ICDC before defining your data 
       collection processes can be beneficial, as the ICDC can help advise on best practices that will enable more 
       efficient and effective submission of the data.'
    - paragraph: '$$#EXPECTATIONS OF DATA:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'Once a project is accepted into the ICDC, the ICDC Data Team will work with the submitter to review the data 
       (i.e., by looking at data structure, data values, and data quality, as well as identifying any standards). The 
       review in turn leads to a submission plan between ICDC and the submitter.'
    - paragraph: 'In developing the submission plan, a primary consideration is that consumers of the data will 
       not be as familiar with the data as the project owners. For example, submitters may find “lymphoma” 
       implicit as a diagnosis in a given data set and thus not have use for such a field. However, this 
       field would need to be explicit for the research community as a whole.'
    - paragraph: 'General guidelines have been established to leverage available community standards where possible 
       for both field name and acceptable values. Common data quality issues are: inconsistent spelling 
       (haemotology versus hematology), inconsistent formatting (“Male” versus “male”), concatenated values 
       which should be separate (“neutered male” should be values in two separate fields), gaps in data 
       (Null data versus empty data versus data not collected) and format (Excel or other database compatible formats versus PDF). 
       The ICDC data team will work with the submitter to identify and resolve these issues.'

  title: "Purpose"
  content:
    - paragraph: "NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) charged the Frederick National Laboratory 
       for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to build the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository 
       of canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative 
       analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced from multiple different programs and projects; 
       all focused on the canine subjects. The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made available 
       to the research community. The ICDC is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an initiative from 
       NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). Bioinformatic analysis of the 
       ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s $$[Cloud Resources](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources)$$."
    - paragraph: 'Within the FNLCR, the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) Directorate is focused on software engineering 
       and data handling. The Applied and Developmental Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee 
       and providing one of the data sources for the ICDC. Finally, there is also an ICDC Steering Committee 
       (composed of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff) that provides advice to DCTD on the ICDC.'

  content:
    - paragraph: '$$#HARMONIZATION/INTEGRATION:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC functions best for the research community when the data is integrated. Once a project 
        is accepted into the ICDC, the ICDC data team will work with the submitter to review the data looking 
        at data structure, data values, data quality as well as identifying any standards that were utilized. 
        Based on that review, a plan for how to submit the data will be agreed upon between ICDC and the submitter.'
    - paragraph: '$$#FAIR AND CITING:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC will adhere to $$[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)$$ principles of data stewardship: Findable, Accessible, 
        Interoperable, and Reusable. Please credit the ICDC in your manuscript. When citing individual projects, 
        please refer to the attribution policies of the project when available.'
    - paragraph: '$$#LICENCE#$$'
    - paragraph: 'Data made available through the ICDC is for research purposes only. The ICDC provides researchers with 
        access to data from canine cancer studies to enable exploratory analysis that cannot be considered definitive for 
        outcomes. All data is publicly available.'
    - paragraph: '$$#DATA MODEL:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC data model is a representation of how all the constituent data are arranged relative to each 
        other. Given the number of studies, the range of study types and the multiple data types that the ICDC needs 
        to support, the data model will need to adapt to the needs of the science. The data model is not static and 
        is expected to change as new needs are identified.'
    - paragraph: 'The SVG graphic below represents the current ICDC data model consisting of data nodes, 
        node properties, and relationships (edges). It provides a comprehensive mapping of the system data, 
        part of which may be viewed in the application interface and UI. In other words, additional nodes and 
        properties are available for inspection and querying beyond those presented on the front-end.'
    - paragraph: 'Additionally, the ICDC Data Model serves as a template for similar initiatives and data structures, 
        including graph-based database schemas. The model will continue to evolve as data needs are further discerned.'
