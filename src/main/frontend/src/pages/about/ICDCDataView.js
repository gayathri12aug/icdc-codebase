The ICDC functions best for the research community when the
data is integrated. Once a project is accepted into the ICDC,
 the ICDC data team will work with the submitter to review the
  data looking at data structure, data values, data quality as
  well as identifying any standards that were utilized. Based
   on that review, a plan for how to submit the data will be
   agreed upon between ICDC and the submitter.
          <p className={classes.title}>Data Model:</p>

The ICDC data model is a representation of how all the
constituent data are arranged relative to each other.
The current data model is available for viewing on CBIITâ€™s
 Github repository (

).
  Given the number of studies, the range of study types and
  the multiple data types that the ICDC needs to support, the
  data model will need to adapt to the needs of the science.
  The data model is not static and is expected to change as
  new needs are identified.
